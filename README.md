A simple Discord bot that fetches data from Wikipedia and sends it into the Discord chat channel with a link.
You only need two things for this. (Not counting hosting)

1-) code pip install discord.py

AND

2-) pip install wikipedia-api

Then create your own bot by going here and creating one. URL: (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Get your bot token and replace it with:

bot.run('YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN')

Voila!

#commands
simply type "!wiki" then a keyword. 

example: "!wiki depp"

"!wiki en depp" will link you to the English wikipedia page. "!wiki tr depp" will link you to the Turkish version. you can add more languages which I have commented on in the code itself.
